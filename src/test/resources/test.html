    <p><strong>As seen on <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized">Fabulously Optimized</a>!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Minecraft's default in-game wording about chat reporting is technical, confusing and gives the assumption that
        chat reporting exists in every server. <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports">No Chat Reports</a>'
        wording is also technical, biased towards negativity and very detailed.
        This resource pack fixes both by replacing those phrases with simple and unbiased, yet accurate phrases.</p>

        </ul>
    </details>
    <h3>What do the icons mean?</h3>
    <p>The icons are only shown when you have <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports">No Chat Reports</a>
        installed. For vanilla chat indicators, hover the gray box on the left.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Yb1n6fW/unknown.png" alt="unknown"/> - status not yet known, you must send one
            chat message to get it
        </li>
        <li><img src="https://i.ibb.co/QDFzXCT/secure.png" alt="disabled"/> - chat reporting is disabled for everyone
        </li>
        <li><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hstcjW7/neutral.png" alt="optional"/> - chat reporting is optional and you opt
            out
            <ul>
                <li>In some cases, it might be fully disabled but not reflected on the icon. You can confirm by seeing
                    if you can report anyone on Social Interactions.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><img src="https://i.ibb.co/2YgMHpR/insecure.png" alt="enabled"/> - chat reporting is enabled for everyone
        </li>
        <li><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gTxw84X/realms.png" alt="realms"/> - only on Realms: chat reporting is enabled
            for everyone and <a

    <h3>Even more questions</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Do I have to use this with <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports">No Chat
            Reports</a>?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: No, though it is recommended to get more accurate status icons.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Do I have to configure No Chat Reports a certain way to benefit from this?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> It has to be enabled and not whitelisting by default to get the indicator icons, any
            other changes are up to you. You may configure it to skip prompts automatically (set &quot;Default signing
            mode&quot; to &quot;On Demand&quot;) to make the experience smoother.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Should I install No Chat Reports even if I like or strongly like the system?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: If you want a clear, consistent indicator about whether chat reporting is active and
            enforced in the server you're in - yes. You can combine vanilla indicators (white bars on chat, warning
            toast, tooltips) as clues to get a similar assumption, but the mod is currently the only way to know for
            sure.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Why is this not in No Chat Reports itself?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: No Chat Reports' default phrases do a better job at describing the technical details and
            giving users traffic light-like indicators to assist on <em>avoiding</em> chat reports. This resource pack
            is meant to be a more neutral approach similar to <a
                    href="https://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q3/Sierra_Oscar_2006/VAC2w.jpg">Steam's &quot;VAC-secured&quot;
                indicator</a> - any user can make their own call on whether seeing the shield icon is a bad or good
            thing. I really hope Mojang will implement something like this in the vanilla game one day.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Does this replace every chat reporting-related phrase and icon?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: No, only the minimum that is required for clear understanding.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: I don't see the changed phrase where I should see it.</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: That might be due to a lack of resource pack translation in your language, so default
            phrases are displayed as a fallback. <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized">Please

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Can I contribute translations to my language?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, please do! <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized">Join the
            Crowdin project</a> and start translating.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Where can I learn more about chat reporting?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: <a href="https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/chat-reporting-faq">I
            have made a detailed writeup for my modpack Fabulously Optimized.</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Backports?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: No. This is intended for Minecraft 1.19.4 and up, because both Minecraft and No Chat
            Reports have made some drastic changes compared to 1.19.3 and older.</p>
